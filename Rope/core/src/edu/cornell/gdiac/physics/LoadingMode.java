/*
 * LoadingMode.java
 *
 * Asset loading is a really tricky problem.  If you have a lot of sound or images,
 * it can take a long time to decompress them and load them into memory.  If you just
 * have code at the start to load all your assets, your game will look like it is hung
 * at the start.
 *
 * The alternative is asynchronous asset loading.  In asynchronous loading, you load a
 * little bit of the assets at a time, but still animate the game while you are loading.
 * This way the player knows the game is not hung, even though he or she cannot do 
 * anything until loading is complete. You know those loading screens with the inane tips 
 * that want to be helpful?  That is asynchronous loading.  
 *
 * This player mode provides a basic loading screen.  While you could adapt it for
 * between level loading, it is currently designed for loading all assets at the 
 * start of the game.

/**
 * Class that provides a loading screen for the state of the game.
 *
 * You still DO NOT need to understand this class for this lab.  We will talk about this
 * class much later in the course.  This class provides a basic template for a loading
 * screen to be used at the start of the game or between levels.  Feel free to adopt
 * this to your needs.
 *
 * You will note that this mode has some textures that are not loaded by the AssetManager.
 * You are never required to load through the AssetManager.  But doing this will block
 * the application.  That is why we try to have as few resources as possible for this
